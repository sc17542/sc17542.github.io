            Tree is an animated short film about a deciduous tree that tries to be friends with a pine tree, only to be made fun of and teased thereafter. The deciduous tree feels stuck having to live with this, until a sudden event changes everything.

            This was created as the final project of a Motion Graphics class at NYU in the Fall 2020 semester. It was also shown at the <a href="https://vimeo.com/489701349">IDM Film Festival that semester</a>. The project was created from November 6 to December 4. I created the assets in Illustrator and animated everything in After Effects. The music is from Fesliyan Studios and the sound effects are from Freesound.
