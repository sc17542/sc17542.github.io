            <p class="montserrat-font">Some renovations at Bobst Library has some hawk viewers concerned about how it could impact the hawks, especially since the scaffolding and ropes hanging over the roof are so close to the nest. Because the hawks usually visit their nest in the months before the nesting season to rebuild their nest, some are worried that the renovation work will disrupt the hawks and lead them to find a new nesting area. As a result, they decided to contact NYU and inform them about the concern they had. <a href="https://rogerpaw.com/2018/10/threat-to-washington-square-nest/">Roger_Paw wrote a blog post on this potential threat</a> on October 5th.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">On October 8th, NYU wrote a response to all those concerned hawk fans:</p>
            
            <blockquote class="montserrat-font" cite="https://rogerpaw.com/2018/10/response-from-nyu/">
                Thank you for your inquiry regarding the ongoing work to the facade of Bobst Library, and for your concern about the red tail hawks' nest on the 12th floor ledge. NYU would like to assure the public that the project team is cognizant of the nest, and is taking steps to ensure that the nest is not disturbed.
                <br><br>
                The facade inspection that is being performed is required under NYC Local Law 11. While we have the rig there for the inspection, we are also cleaning the facade. However, our team is very aware of the sensitivity of the nest and has delineated an area surrounding the nest which they will not touch. The platform will not extend above the 11th floor, and the outrigger lines for the rig will remain clear of the nest. Though there are safety lines that extend from the roof that may pass in front of the nest, they will not touch the nest.
                <br><br>
                This is short term work that will be completed well in advance of the January period during which the hawks typically return to the next more frequently, and the scaffolding will be gone long before the March nesting season begins.
            </blockquote>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">NYU has stated that they are being cautious of the nest area and will try not to disturb the nest during this required renovation period. Although they acknowledge NYU's response, some hawk viewers still express a bit of concern that the hawks they have enjoyed watching over the years may not return to this nest.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">As shown in the article picture, there is currently a white rope that can be seen occasionally on the hawk cam. It remains to be seen whether or not the hawks decide to return for another year, but since NYU projects the renovation to finish well before January, it shouldn't interfere with the hawks enough for them to find a whole new nesting place.</p>
