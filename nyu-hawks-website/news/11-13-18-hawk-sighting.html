            <p class="montserrat-font">In the chatroom of NYU Hawk Camâ€™s Ustream page, it was commented that one of the hawks was on the nest moving sticks around at around 12:18 PM today. The visit was said to have ended at around 12:32 PM. The viewer is unsure on which hawk it was, but guesses that it may have been the male hawk. The workers were also reportedly seen on cam right after the hawk had left.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">As of yet, the night cam still doesn't seem to be functioning. Without the infrared light from the night cam, it is harder to see the nest at night, as can be seen from the picture above.</p>
