                <br><br>
                The female hawk was on the nest at the time.
                <br><br>
                At 2:42 PM, the male hawk arrived with a half-eaten pigeon. The female hawk got up from incubating, took the pigeon from her mate, and flew off. The male hawk took over incubation duties.
                <br><br>
                At 3:52 PM, the female hawk arrived and the male hawk soon left.
                <br><br>
                Sometime before 6:51 PM (but definitely after 6 PM), the male hawk had made a shift change with the female hawk.
                <br><br>
                At 7:26 PM, a chat member reported that the last shift change of the day had been made, with the female hawk on the nest.

                <br><br>
                The male hawk was on the nest at the time.
                <br><br>
                He was also reportedly on the nest at 9:13 AM, but it's unknown when the shift change was.
                <br><br>
                (I checked in on the livestream again at 12:41 PM.)
                <br><br>
                The male hawk was still on the nest, but it's unknown if there had been any shift changes in between.
                <br><br>
                (I joined the livestream again at 1:40 PM.)
                <br><br>
                The female hawk was on the nest and it was reported by a chat member that the shift change had happened at 1:34 PM.
                <br><br>
                The bottom half of a pigeon was on the nest in front of the female hawk.
                <br><br>
                Sometime before or around 3:26 PM, the male hawk had visited the nest. He left at 3:27 PM.
                <br><br>
                The female hawk was nodding off several times throughout the day.
                <br><br>
                At 4:39 PM, the male hawk arrived on the ledge. The female hawk got up, took the pigeon that was on the nest, and flew off. The male hawk soon went to incubate the eggs.
                <br><br>
                (I left the livestream at 5:45 PM and came back at 7:07 PM.)
                <br><br>
                The female hawk was on the nest.

                (I did a quick check of the livestream at 7:30 AM.)
                <br><br>
                The female hawk was on the nest partially sleeping.
                <br><br>
                At around 9:30 AM, a chat member had reported that there was no one on the nest until the female hawk soon arrived.
                <br><br>
                (I did check-ins at 12:25 PM, 2:13 PM, and 3:57 PM.)
                <br><br>
                The female hawk was on the nest for all of those times, but it's unknown if there were any shift changes in between.
                <br><br>
                At 6:54 PM, a chat member said that the female hawk had come back to the nest, meaning that she had left earlier, but it's unknown if the male hawk was here at any point.

                At 9:59 AM, a chat member reported that both of the hawks were here and that the female hawk was returning to take over incubation duties.

                The male hawk was on the nest.
                <br><br>
                There may have been a rat that one of them caught in the park on the nest.

                The male hawk was on the nest. He was reportedly on at 7:28 AM too, but it's unknown when he first arrived on the nest.
                <br><br>
                Acccording to a chat member, there may have been a shift change before 8:36 AM.
                <br><br>
                At 12:23 PM, a chat member made some comments about the male hawk, which may mean that he was on the nest at the time. The comments were about a piece of paper that he had brought in earlier.
                <br><br>
                (I joined the livestream at 2:12 PM.)
                <br><br>
                The female hawk was on the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 2:49 PM, the female hawk got up and moved the piece of paper around. At 3:04 PM, she was tugging at the paper and trying to reposition it. At 3:54 PM, she picked up the paper, got up, and tried to figure out where to put it. She tried putting it in the nest bowl and then went to sit down at 3:57 PM, but she was still getting at the paper.
