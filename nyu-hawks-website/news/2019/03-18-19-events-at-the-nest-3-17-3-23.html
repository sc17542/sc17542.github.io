                (I did a quick check-in early in the morning that ended at 7:07 AM.)
                <br><br>
                At 6:44 AM, the male hawk was seen at the nest incubating the egg. The female hawk was there prior to that, so they must have made a switch (which I missed) a couple minutes before.
                <br><br>
                According to the hawk cam chat messages that I saw, the female hawk was on at 12:14 PM and before. She had made a shift change with the male hawk prior to that. There was also another shift change before 12:34 PM where the male hawk had switched with the female hawk.
                <br><br>
                (I joined the livestream again at 1:19 PM.)
                <br><br>
                At 1:19 PM, there was no one at the nest but the egg.
                <br><br>
                At 1:21 PM, the male hawk flew to the nest and a minute later, he flew off with a half-eaten rat or pigeon. (I don't know if it was already on the nest or if he came in with it and took it off immediately.)
                <br><br>
                At 1:24 PM, the male hawk came back to go incubate the egg.
                <br><br>
                At 2:07 PM, the male hawk flies off the nest. Two minutes later, the female hawk arrives at the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 3:13 PM, the female hawk leaves. Two minutes later, the male hawk arrives.
                <br><br>
                At around 3:46 PM, the male hawk gets up to move a stick and then fly off the nest. At 3:48 PM, the female hawk arrives.
                <br><br>
                At 4:23 PM, the female hawk leaves. At 4:29 PM, the male hawk arrives.
                <br><br>
                At 5:39 PM, the female hawk flies onto the ledge. The male hawk soon gets up and flies off.
                <br><br>
                At around 6:57 PM, the female hawk may have left and the male hawk was on the nest with a rat before leaving.
                <br><br>
                At 7:05 PM, the male hawk comes back to take over incubation duties. He stayed there past sunset and into the night, which normally doesn't happen. For hawks, the female hawk is the one who stays on the nest overnight, while the male hawk is the one who sleeps away from the nest but still has a good view of it. Chat members who have been here since the first year have said that they don't think that they've ever seen this happen before.
                <br><br>
                As of 1:06 AM, he is still on the nest, sleeping and incubating the egg.
                <br><br>
                (I stopped watching at 1:06 AM.)
