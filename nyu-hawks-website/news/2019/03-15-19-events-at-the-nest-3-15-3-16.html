                At 3:40 PM, the female hawk went to sit down on the nest. When she got up at 3:45 PM, it was revealed that she had laid the first egg of 2019 when viewers saw that there was an egg underneath her. The male hawk had visited sometime after and they both spent some time looking at the egg. He later left.
                <br><br>
                At 5:42 PM, the male hawk arrived at the nest again. The female hawk didn't get up right away, but eventually did. The male hawk turned to get another look at the egg in the nest bowl. At 5:44 PM, he flew off.
                <br><br>
                At 6:30 PM, the male hawk returned with what appeared to be a mouse or a small rat. He left it on the nest for the female hawk. At 6:32 PM, he flew off.
