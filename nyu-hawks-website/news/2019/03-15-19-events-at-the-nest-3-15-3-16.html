                At 3:40 PM, the female hawk went to sit down on the nest. When she got up at 3:45 PM, it was revealed that she had laid the first egg of 2019 when viewers saw that there was an egg underneath her. The male hawk had visited sometime after and they both spent some time looking at the egg. He later left.
                <br><br>
                At 5:42 PM, the male hawk arrived at the nest again. The female hawk didn't get up right away, but eventually did. The male hawk turned to get another look at the egg in the nest bowl. At 5:44 PM, he flew off.
                <br><br>
                At 6:30 PM, the male hawk returned with what appeared to be a mouse or a small rat. He left it on the nest for the female hawk. At 6:32 PM, he flew off.

                (I joined the livestream at 4:05 PM.)
                <br><br>
                The female hawk was incubating the egg at the time.
                <br><br>
                At around 4:20 PM, the male hawk arrived to make a shift change in incubation duties with the female hawk.
                <br><br>
                While still sitting on the egg, he tried to readjust the nest material around him. One such material was a white napkin, which he had some struggles with. He attempted to tuck the napkin in the nest bowl as he was sitting in it. However, it was a windy day and the napkin ended up flying around the nest before being blown away from Bobst Library at 4:30 PM.
                <br><br>

                In an effort to continue with the nest rearrangement, he got up from sitting at 4:38 PM to try to move a big stick that was sticking out of the nest. He kept trying to pull at it with his beak, but it was stuck within some other sticks on the nest. Eventually, he got it untangled and was able to move it to a spot where it wouldn't cause problems for them.

                <br><br>
                At around 5:39 PM, the male hawk flew off. The female hawk was reportedly seen flying by. She arrived at the nest at 5:41 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 6:10 PM, the female hawk left. Two minutes later, the male hawk arrived.
                <br><br>
                At 6:51 PM, the female hawk made a shift change with the male hawk.
                <br><br>
                (I stopped watching at 7:22 PM, but I think that was the last shift change for the day.)
