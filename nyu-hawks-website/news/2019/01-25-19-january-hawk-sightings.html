            <p class="montserrat-font">Thank you to all of the chat members that got up early to watch the hawk cam and reported any visits that occurred!</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">This list may not contain all the visits that happened over the course of the month (some visits may go unreported and some will be missed), but these are the ones that I saw being reported in the NYU Hawk Cam Ustream chatroom and one that I saw myself.</p>
