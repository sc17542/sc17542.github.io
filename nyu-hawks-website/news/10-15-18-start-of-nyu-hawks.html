            <p class="montserrat-font">The NYU Hawks website has officially been launched!</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">Since 2011, the male hawk and his female partner have been visiting the nest on the 12th floor of Bobst Library every year to raise their young.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">With the creation of this website, there will now be a place to get your news about what happens on the hawk cam throughout the spring. That includes basic information such as when the eggs are laid or when they hatch, but also information on day-to-day occurrences such as shift changes for egg incubation, feedings for the eyasses, and any attempts the eyasses make at flying.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">Although I will try my best to document everything that goes on at the nest, understand that not all information will be caught. The hawk cam runs 24 hours a day and due to daily schedules, I won't always be able to watch every single minute of the action. That being said, I will do the best I can to document whatever I'm able to see and anything that the hawk cam chat members say that they saw.</p>
