            <p class="montserrat-font">Today, there were some reported sightings of the adult hawks returning to the nest. However, the hawk cam footage is too blurry to confirm which hawk  was which.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">There may be more instances where they have shown up on the webcam, but these are the ones that were reported:</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">At 8:41 AM, one of the NYU hawk cam chat members commented that they saw what they thought was the male hawk Bobby placing a stick onto the nest.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">At 12:11 PM, I saw a hawk on the nest, possibly the male hawk, standing and looking out to Washington Square Park.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">At 12:19 PM, the other hawk flew in and joined its partner on the nest for a short amount of time before taking off again.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">At 12:21 PM, the remaining hawk flew away from the nest.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">At 12:26 PM, one of the hawks returned and quickly adjusted one of the sticks before flying off about a minute later.</p>
