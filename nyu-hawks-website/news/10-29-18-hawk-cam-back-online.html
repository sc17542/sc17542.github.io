            <p class="montserrat-font">In case you hadn’t checked the hawk cam for the past week or so, there was nothing to see.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">After almost two weeks of being offline, the hawk cam is live once again. Since then, the two hawks have been spotted in the surrounding area of Washington Square Park by various hawk watchers. </p>

            <p class="montserrat-font">As of right now, it doesn’t seem like the night version of the hawk cam, which uses infrared light to make the nest visible at night in black-and-white footage, is being used. However, as seen in the picture above, the light coming from the the NYU President’s office is bright enough to allow us to see the nest tonight.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">The renovation at Bobst Library continues on, but considering that the hawks are still in the area, it appears that they haven’t been considerably disturbed by the work going on near their nest.</p>
