                I joined the livestream at 2:38 PM and Aurora was standing over the eyasses. It was a rainy day. There was some kind of food on the nest, possibly a squirrel.
                <br><br>
                At 3:20 PM, Aurora left. She returned at 3:44 PM. She continued to stand over them.
                <br><br>
                I left at 4:32 PM and returned at 6:06 PM. Aurora was standing.
                <br><br>
                At 6:40 PM, Aurora tried to go sit on them, but with the eyasses being bigger now, she isn't able to cover all of them. She just ended up sitting very closely next to them.
                <br><br>
                At around 7:32 PM, the infrared night cam turned on.
                <br><br>
                At around 7:48 PM, Aurora was feeding them, possibly with the squirrel. She left at 7:54 PM and returned at 7:56 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 8:41 PM, the livestream went off-air. The chat said that it came back on at 10:37 PM.
                <br><br>
                In the night, Aurora was trying to cover the eyasses, presumably because of how windy and rainy it was.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="cabin-font">May 6</h3>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">
                I checked in on the livestream at 12:42 PM and the eyasses were alone. According to the chat, they were also alone at 12:02 PM. It was a sunnier day today.
                <br><br>
                I rejoined the livestream at 1:34 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 2:24 PM, Aurora arrived. She left again at 2:36 PM. The eyasses were preening themselves.
                <br><br>
                At 3:21 PM, Aurora returned with food and started feeding them. At 3:28 PM, she took the leftovers, which (to me) looked like the tail of a squirrel, and flew off.
                <br><br>
                At 3:34 PM, one of the eyasses was grabbing at the leaves on a stick on the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 4:24 PM, Aurora returned. She later left and came back again.
                <br><br>
                At 5:12 PM, the livestream went off-air briefly, but it quickly returned within a minute.
                <br><br>
                At 5:19 PM, one of the eyasses was grabbing onto Aurora's tail as she was looking out to the park, preparing to fly off. She soon left. She returned at 5:21 PM, but quickly left again. She returned again at 5:27 PM, but left again at 5:29 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 5:51 PM, one of the eyasses tried to stand, but she quickly ended up sitting again.
                <br><br>
                At 6:23 PM, Aurora arrived with food, which may have been a bird, and started a feeding. All of the eyasses seemed to be very hungry as all of them were quickly getting at Aurora's beak for the food pieces. At 6:29 PM, there was a short tug-of-war among the eyasses for a food piece. At one point, an eyass took a feathery piece from Aurora and was struggling to get it down, but she eventually did. Aurora left at 6:34 PM and returned at around 7:40 PM.
                <br><br>
                According to the chat, the eyasses were starting to walk today, meaning that they progressing in their development.
                <br><br>
                At 8:16 PM, Aurora was preening the eyasses.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="cabin-font">May 7</h3>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">
                I joined the livestream for a short time at 5:40 AM. Aurora was awake and was standing over the eyasses.
                <br><br>
                At 5:41 AM, Aurora left. She returned at 5:43 AM. At 5:48 AM, she left again and returned quickly. At 5:50 AM, she left again. At 5:56 AM, as the infrared night cam switched into the daytime color cam, she returned. At 5:57 AM, she left again. She returned again at 5:58 AM, but left again at 5:59 AM. At 6:00 AM, she returned, but left quickly once again.
                <br><br>
                I had to leave at 6:19 AM, but I was interested in knowing why Aurora was flying back and forth so quickly. She hadn't returned by the time I left.
                <br><br>
                I checked in quickly at 10:07 AM and Aurora was here. The chat had said that the eyasses ate some kind of bird for breakfast.
                <br><br>
                I joined the livestream at 12:27 PM. Aurora was feeding the eyasses with a bird. There were a lot of feathers from the bird on the nest. An eyass near the back had a lot of small feathers stuck to its beak. From how the eyasses were eating, it seemed like they were hungry.
                <br><br>
                At 12:51 PM, Aurora took some small, white, fluffy feather leftovers and left. She returned at 12:52 PM.
                <br><br>
                I checked in at 1:54 PM and Aurora was gone.
                <br><br>
                At several points in the day, the eyasses were preening themselves.
                <br><br>
                At around 3:22 PM, Aurora returned on the ledge and walked onto the nest. She may have been picking at some leftovers. At 3:29 PM, she may have started feeding the eyasses. One of the eyasses tried standing, but quickly sat again. At 3:44 PM, Aurora took the leftovers and left. An eyass tried to practice standing while the other two watched her. One of them joined her in standing, but they all eventually sat down again. One of them was also trying to flap her wings. They all started sleeping at 3:53 PM.
                <br><br>
                I left at 3:56 PM and came back at 7:15 PM. The eyasses were alone on the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 7:16 PM, Aurora arrived with what may have been a bird. She left with it at 7:18 PM. She returned at 7:22 PM. She took some leftovers and left at 7:24 PM. She came back sometime before 7:30 PM.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="cabin-font">May 8</h3>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">
                At 8:22 AM, the chat said that Aurora was here about an hour ago and fed them before she left.
                <br><br>
                At 8:43 AM, the chat said that Aurora was here.
                <br><br>
                At 10:18 AM, the chat said that a pigeon was brought to the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 11:54 AM, the chat said that the eyasses just ate.
                <br><br>
                I joined the livestream at 12:24 PM. The eyasses were alone on the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 12:38 PM, Aurora arrived on the ledge and walked onto the nest. She started picking at some food on the nest. At 12:40 PM, she started feeding the eyasses with what may have been a pigeon. She flew off with the leftovers at 12:53 PM. At 12:57 PM, she returned with a leafy branch. She took some more leftovers and flew off. At 1:00 PM, she returned with some leftovers, but quickly left with them a minute later.
                <br><br>
                At 2:05 PM, Aurora arrived with what may have been a pigeon. She soon started to de-feather the pigeon and the small, white feathers were tossed all over the eyasses. She started feeding them at 2:08 PM. At 2:10 PM, she started de-feathering the pigeon again. The nest was soon covered in small, white feathers. At 2:14 PM, she continued to de-feather. She flew off with some leftovers at 2:34 PM.
                <br><br>
                I left momentarily at 2:37 PM and returned at 2:55 PM. Aurora was here.
                <br><br>
                At 3:53 PM, Aurora started de-feathering the same pigeon that was on the nest. She started feeding the eyasses. At 4:09 PM, she took a pigeon wing and left.
                <br><br>
                Some day before, the chat spotted a hawk feather that was on the edge of the nest. It was a molted feather from one of the parents. It was still here today.
                <br><br>
                At 5:11 PM, Aurora arrived on the ledge and walked up to the nest. She started picking at the same pigeon on the nest and began feeding the eyasses again. At 5:20 PM, she left with a pigeon wing.
                <br><br>
                At 5:25 PM, Aurora returned on the ledge, but may have left while she was there. At 5:27 PM, she arrived on the nest.
                <br><br>
                According to the chat, Bobby hasn't been around since Monday, May 6. They reported that they last saw him in the morning of that day. No one has reported seeing him in the park since that time either. It is unusual for him to be missing for that long during the nesting season.
                <br><br>
                At 6:04 PM, a chat member said that the Wild Bird Fund found an injured hawk and that they were wondering if it was Bobby. However, a few days later from May 8, it was discovered that this hawk had been there for a while, before Bobby had disappeared. This ruled out the possibility that this hawk was Bobby.
                <br><br>
                I checked in at 6:24 PM and Aurora was gone.
                <br><br>
                At around 7:36 PM, Aurora arrived, took a small bit of leftovers, and flew off. She returned at 7:45 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 8:10 PM, the infrared night cam turned on.
                <br><br>
                At 8:13 PM, Aurora may have been feeding the eyasses with the same pigeon from earlier.
                <br><br>
                I stayed up throughout the whole night (for school purposes) and had the livestream on.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="cabin-font">May 9</h3>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">
                I had stayed up through the night of May 8 into the morning of May 9. Aurora had slept for practically the whole time.
                <br><br>
                At 4:18 AM, Aurora stretched for a bit and then left. She returned at 4:56 AM.
                <br><br>
                At 5:28 AM, Aurora was preening the eyasses. She left at 5:31 AM and returned at 5:33 AM. At 5:37 AM, she left again. At 5:38 AM, the infrared night cam changed into the daytime color cam. She returned at 5:51 AM, but left again at 5:56 AM. She returned again at 5:58 AM, but left again at 6:00 AM.
                <br><br>
                At 6:21 AM, Aurora arrived, possibly with food. At 6:34 AM, she started feeding the eyasses with a squirrel. She stopped the feeding at around 7:16 AM.
                <br><br>
                I left at 7:45 AM. Aurora was still here at the time. I rejoined at 11:54 AM.
                <br><br>
                At 12:02 PM, Aurora left. One of the eyasses had a long piece of what the chat said was bone or cartilage stuck in her mouth. Part of it was in her and some of it was sticking out. At 12:09 PM, the eyass tried swallowing the long piece, but it didn't go anywhere.
                <br><br>
                At around 12:20 PM, Aurora arrived on the ledge and walked onto the ledge.
                <br><br>
                At 1:17 PM, Aurora left.
                <br><br>
                At 1:31 PM, the eyass with the long piece was still trying to get the piece down, but didn't. The eyasses soon started preening themselves. They started sleeping at 1:46 PM.
                <br><br>
                The eyass with the long piece stuck in her beak did eventually get it down sometime later in the day.
                <br><br>
                I left the livestream at 2:00 PM and returned at 7:04 PM. Aurora was feeding the eyasses with what may have been a bird.
                <br><br>
                At 7:10 PM, Aurora took the leftovers and left. At 7:45 PM, she arrived and picked up a wing that was on the nest. She took a small piece out of it and tried to see if any of the eyasses wanted food. One eyass eventually took it from her. Aurora then started de-feathering the leftovers and feeding the eyasses. She left with the wing at 7:51 PM and returned at 7:58 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 7:59 PM, the infrared night cam turned on.

            <p class="montserrat-font">
                I joined the livestream at 4:00 PM. Aurora was standing on the nest. An eyass was trying to grab one of her wings.
                <br><br>
                At 4:08 PM, Aurora left. She returned at around 4:11 PM. A chat member nearby had heard her calling while she was out.
                <br><br>
                At 4:20 PM, Aurora left. The chat member had heard her calling again. At 4:26 PM, she returned on the ledge with a freshly caught squirrel, fully intact. She soon flew onto the nest with the squirrel. She started the feeding at 4:31 PM. The eyasses seemed hungry. According to the chat, this was the third meal of the day, but the previous two meals were starlings, which may not have been enough to satisfy the eyasses.
                <br><br>
                The eyasses are starting to grow in their pin feathers on their wings, continuing to progress in their development.
                <br><br>
                At 5:21 PM, Aurora left. She returned at 5:23 PM.
                <br><br>
                At around 5:44 PM, Aurora was getting at the squirrel. At 5:46 PM, she started to feed them again, but only one eyass was eating. At 5:46 PM, the other two eyasses soon got up to eat also. Some of them were picking at the actual squirrel during the feeding, but none of them were self-feeding just yet. Aurora stopped the feeding sometime before 6:03 PM.
                <br><br>
                I left at 6:08 PM. I checked in at 2:06 AM of tomorrow and Aurora was preening the eyasses. She also preened them at 2:30 AM.

                I joined the livestream at 2:15 PM.
                <br><br>
                The chat had said that Aurora brought a rat today, which was the first rat since Bobby's disappearance. She had been mostly bringing pigeons and squirrels as of right now. Back when Bobby was around, he would always bring several rats to the nest.
                <br><br>
                At around 2:20 PM, Aurora arrived with a leafy branch. She soon left.
                <br><br>
                At 2:26 PM, Aurora arrived with some kind of material and put it in the nest. She soon left and came back at around 3:58 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 4:08 PM, Aurora and the eyasses were all preening themselves.
                <br><br>
                At 4:33 PM, Aurora left. She came back sometime later.
                <br><br>
                At 5:36 PM, Aurora started feeding the eyasses with a bird
                <br><br>
                At 7:36 PM, the chat said that Aurora may have eaten some leftovers.
