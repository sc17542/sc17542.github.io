                I checked in at 2:39 AM and the eggs were still intact.
                <br><br>
                I checked in again at 8:59 AM and Bobby was here.
                <br><br>
                I joined at 6:48 PM and Bobby was here.
                <br><br>
                At around 7:15 PM, Aurora arrived and Bobby left.
                <br><br>
                The infrared night cam turned on at 7:49 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 7:51 PM, Bobby arrived on the nest with a rat. Aurora took the rat from him and flew off. Bobby soon went to go sit on the eggs.
                <br><br>
                At around 8:00 PM, Aurora returned and Bobby left. This was the last shift change for the day.

            <p class="montserrat-font">
                I joined in at 12:00 PM and Aurora was here.
                <br><br>
                There was a hatch very early in the morning, the first hatch of the nesting season (<a href="https://www.ustream.tv/recorded/121416484">Video of the First Hatch</a>). The hatch may have occurred at around 6 AM. The first-born eyass will be referred to as I-1.
                <br><br>
                I left at 1:04 PM and joined again at 2:41 PM. Aurora was on the nest.
                <br><br>
                The livestream continued to freeze occasionally.
                <br><br>
                At 3:49 PM, Bobby arrived. He left at 3:51 PM.
                <br><br>
                At around 3:54 PM, Aurora started preening I-1. I-1 seemed to be very talkative.
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                At around 4:06 PM, I-1 was underneath Aurora again.
                <br><br>
                At around 4:20 PM, Bobby arrived with a pigeon and later left.
                <br><br>
                At around 4:34 PM, Aurora started feeding small bits of pigeon to I-1, which would be I-1's first ever meal. There was a noticeable pip on one of the other eggs, meaning that another hatch would happen soon. At 4:40 PM, Aurora ended the feeding and went back to sitting on the eyass and the two eggs.
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                At 5:56 PM, Aurora left and Bobby arrived soon after. At 6:00 PM, Aurora returned with what may have been a pigeon. She may have started feeding I-1 again. At 6:01 PM, Bobby left. At 6:04 PM, Aurora went to sit again.
                <br><br>

                The second hatch of the nesting season happened sometime before 6:45 AM, although no one is sure when exactly it was. (<a href="https://www.ustream.tv/recorded/121448662">Video of a Morning Feeding</a>)
                <br><br>
                I checked in at 10:27 AM and Aurora was feeding the two eyasses. She had left and came back and then left another time and returned once again. She went back to sitting on the eyasses and the egg. She also ate some of the leftover pigeon.
                <br><br>
                I joined the livestream again at 12:15 PM. There was a rat on the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 12:17 PM, Aurora left. Three minutes later, Bobby left. Aurora later brought in a twig with leaves on it. Afterward, she started feeding the eyasses with the rat that was on the nest. At 12:31 PM, she went to sit on them again. As she went to go sit down, she nearly stepped on one of the eyasses (but it's not anything anyone should worry about).
                <br><br>
                
                <img class="secondary-news-image" src="../../images/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-23%20at%2012.30.35%20PM.png" alt="On April 23, 2019, Aurora looks at the two eyasses, one of them newly-hatched, and the last remaining egg in the nest.">
                
                <br><br>
                At 12:52 PM, Aurora got up for two minutes and went to sit down again. She nearly stepped on one of the eyasses again.
                <br><br>
                At 12:58 PM, Aurora got up, took the rat, and flew off. She returned at 1:01 PM and soon went back to sitting.
                <br><br>
                I left the livestream at 1:44 PM and came back at 2:30 PM.
                <br><br>
                At around 3:03 PM, Aurora left. She came back at 3:07 PM, but left again at 3:08 PM. A minute later, Bobby arrived. At 3:11 PM, Aurora arrived with a torn-up pigeon. Bobby left soon after. Aurora started feeding the eyasses with the pigeon she brought. She sat back down at 3:20 PM.
                <br><br>
                While the egg was visible, there were talks about a possible pip in the third egg.
                <br><br>
                I left at 3:20 PM and returned at 7:35 PM.
                <br><br>
                At around 7:38 PM, Bobby arrived. Aurora was eating some of the leftovers of the pigeon that was brought earlier. At 7:42 PM, she flew off with the leftover pigeon. Bobby tried readjusting a very thin stick on the nest. At 7:46 PM, Aurora returned. Bobby soon left and Aurora went to go sit.
                <br><br>
                I left at 7:53 PM and returned at 9:08 PM.
                <br><br>
                Aurora was preening the eyasses on several occasions, including at 9:21 PM and 9:33 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 10:02 PM, Aurora was moving around the cardboard on the nest.
                <br><br>
                After midnight, Aurora was preening the eyasses again, including at 12:55 AM and 1:35 AM.

            <h3 class="cabin-font">Apr. 24</h3>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">
                I joined at around 12:04 PM. The screen was black at the time, possibly since around 11:40 AM. The cam returned at 12:35 PM. Aurora was sitting on the nest.
                <br><br>
                At around 1:23 PM, Bobby had arrived and left.
                <br><br>
                At 1:34 PM, Aurora got up and sat down.
                <br><br>
                At 1:52 PM, Aurora left, leaving the two eyasses alone. One of them started pecking at the egg and then at her sibling. The eyass continued to peck at her sibling for a while. According to the chatroom hawk expert, the pecking is nothing to be concerned about, as it helps the eyasses practice motor skills. No one is harmed in the process since their beaks aren't as sharp yet.
                <br><br>
                
                <img class="secondary-news-image" src="../../images/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-24%20at%201.53.37%20PM.png" alt="On April 24, 2019, the two young eyasses are in the nest alone, also with an egg. One of the eyasses had pecked the other one.">
                
                <br><br>
                While the egg was visible, there may have been a pip that could be seen on the egg.
                <br><br>
                At 1:57 PM, Aurora returned with what may have been a really torn-up pigeon. The eyass that was pecking earlier continued to peck at the other one. Aurora started feeding them at 1:59 PM. Both of the eyasses were being fed.
                <br><br>
                
                <img class="secondary-news-image" src="../../images/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-24%20at%202.01.40%20PM.png" alt="On April 24, 2019, Aurora feeds the two young eyasses some small pieces of pigeon.">
                
                <br><br>
                At 2:04 PM, Aurora ate a fluffy, cutton-like material that was on the nest. She quickly turned towards the office window, which may or may not have meant that she heard something through the window. She went back to feeding them for a bit before sitting at 2:06 PM.
                <br><br>
                At around 3:06 PM, Aurora got up and may have started feeding them. She sat down again at 3:10 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 3:13 PM, Bobby arrived with a beheaded rat and soon left.
                <br><br>
                The chat had mentioned that Bobby brought some greens along with a pigeon a few hours ago.
                <br><br>
                I left at 3:58 PM and joined again at 5:17 PM. The cam was occasionally freezing.
                <br><br>
                At 5:32 PM, Aurora was feeding the eyasses with the very torn-up pigeon. She flew off with the leftovers at 5:34 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 5:35 PM, Bobby arrived. The eyasses were pecking each other. At 5:37 PM, Bobby left and the eyasses were still pecking each other. He may have took the beheaded rat away with him. With the egg now visible, there was a big pip that could be seen on the egg.
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                At 5:38 PM, Aurora arrived on the ledge and went to go sit on the eyasses and the egg.
                <br><br>
                There was a light blue material folded into a square in the nest. I'm not sure when it was brought to the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 6:50 PM, Aurora got up and soon left. At 6:53 PM, an eyass was pecking the other eyass. A minute later, an eyass was grabbing at the cardboard and the cardboard flipped over. The pecking continued afterward.
                <br><br>
                
                <img class="secondary-news-image" src="../../images/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-24%20at%206.52.10%20PM.png" alt="On April 24, 2019, the two young eyasses are in the nest alone.">

                <br><br>
                At 6:56 PM, Aurora returned with a rat/mouse. The pecking continued. An eyass was also pecking at the blue, folded square. Aurora started feeding them at 6:58 PM. At around 7:09 PM, Aurora went to go sit on them.
                <br><br>
                The pip on the egg had turned into a noticeable crack, meaning that a third hatch would happen soon.
                <br><br>
                At 7:18 PM, Bobby arrived with what may have been a torn-apart rat and later left.
                <br><br>
                At around 7:45 PM, Aurora got up and tried to feed the eyasses with the rat that Bobby brought, but they didn't want to eat. She returned to sitting at 7:47 PM.
                <br><br>
                The infrared night cam turned on at around 7:52 PM to 7:53 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 7:59 PM, Bobby arrived, possibly with food (hard to tell since the night cam was on), and soon left.
                <br><br>
                At around 8:00 PM to 8:01 PM, the egg was seen hatching. Aurora was trying to feed the two eyasses as the third eyass was trying to break out of her egg. This marked the third and final hatch of the nesting season. At 8:04 PM, Aurora went to sit on them.
                <br><br>
                
                <img class="secondary-news-image" src="../../images/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-24%20at%208.02.34%20PM.png" alt="On April 24, 2019, the third egg hatches as Aurora starts to feed the other two eyasses.">
                
                <br><br>
                At 8:46 PM, Aurora was preening I-3, who was right in front of her. At 8:50 PM, she started to eat part of one half of I-3's egg shell. At 8:59 PM, she tried to tuck the cardboard into the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 9:25 PM, Aurora was preening one of the eyasses.
                <br><br>
                At 10:46 PM, Aurora got up, took the rat, and soon flew off with the rat. She returned at 10:50 PM and soon went to sit on them.
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                I checked in at 12:13 AM of April 25 and saw Aurora carrying something to the other side of the nest. She soon went to go sit.

            <p class="montserrat-font">
                I joined the livestream at 12:27 PM. Aurora was about to go sit.
                <br><br>
                At 12:58 PM, Aurora left. At 1:00 PM, one of the eyasses was pecking at another. Aurora soon returned, and the eyass that was pecking continued pecking. The one that got pecked soon pecked back. They got sleepy for a couple seconds, but continued with the pecking at 1:03 PM. The eyass not involved in the pecking was peeping a lot. Aurora went to sit on them at 1:18 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 1:29 PM, Aurora started feeding the eyasses with what may have been a pigeon. The eyass that was peeping earlier was being fed first, but the eyass near the front pecked her and got fed. The eyass that was peeping got up and was fed again. Later, that eyass was gently pecking at the right eyass's beak, possibly thinking that there was food there. Aurora soon moved with the food and blocked the view of the feeding.
                <br><br>
                At 1:40 PM, Aurora left. The eyass on the right started pecking the eyass near the front. At 1:41 PM, Bobby arrived. He tried to go sit on the eyasses, which isn't something he would normally do as a tiercel. He sat on them for a bit. At 1:49 PM, one of the eyasses sliced and part of it may or may not have gotten on the food. At 1:50 PM, Bobby got up and tried to move in closer to sit on them. He started preening the eyass on the right for a few seconds.

                At 1:54 PM, Aurora arrived. Bobby soon got up and left. At 1:57 PM, Aurora tried to go sit on them, but the two eyasses that were pecking each other earlier were pecking each other again so Aurora only partially sat on them.
                <br><br>
                At 2:04 PM, Aurora was preening the eyass in the front for a few seconds.
                <br><br>
                At 2:11 PM, Aurora got up and tried to see if any of the eyasses were hungry. They continued to sleep so Aurora went back to sitting at 2:13 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 2:36 PM, Aurora started feeding the eyasses with the bird that they were eating earlier. The eyass on the right pecked at the eyass near the front.
                <br><br>
                At 2:50 PM, Aurora left. She came back at 2:52 PM and went to sit on them at 2:54 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 3:19 PM, Aurora was picking at something in the nest. The eyass that was peeping earlier started peeping again.
                <br><br>
                I left temporarily at 3:30 PM. At that time, Aurora was standing over the nest, while the peeping eyass occasionally picks her head up and peeps.
                <br><br>
                I came back at 3:36 PM and Aurora was sitting.
                <br><br>
                I left again at 4:13 PM. At that time, Aurora was standing over the nest.
                <br><br>
                I joined again at 8:52 PM and Aurora was sitting, preening herself.

                I joined the livestream at 1:52 PM and Aurora was sitting. It was raining at the time.
                <br><br>
                At 2:05 PM, Aurora was up. She took the rat and was preparing to fly off. She almost tripped on the plastic blue string on the nest. She dropped and stomped on the torn-up rat. She finally flew off with the rat at 2:14 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 2:15 PM, Bobby arrived and stayed for two minutes before leaving. The front eyass started pecking at the back eyass's beak. The back eyass then started pecking away at the front eyass and later pecked the left eyass.
                <br><br>
                At 2:18 PM, Aurora arrived and the eyasses stopped pecking each other. At 2:19 PM, Bobby arrived. One of them had brought food. Aurora started feeding the eyasses. At 2:20 PM, Bobby left. At 2:23 PM, Aurora left with a rat. The pecking had started once again, but eventually stopped. At 2:24 PM, Aurora returned and soon went to go sit on them.
                <br><br>
                At 2:48 PM, Aurora got up. At 2:53 PM, the chat had said that she was preening the eyasses for a few seconds. At around 3:02 PM, she was sort of sitting on them, but wasn't covering all of them completely. She soon got off them, but was still sort of sitting near them. She later started moving around the cardboard before sitting near the eyasses again.
                <br><br>
                At around 4:22 PM, Aurora got up and left. An eyass started pecking at another eyass. The same eyass continued to peck at the other one, who tried to move away. The eyass stopped for a bit before continuing to peck once again.
                <br><br>
                At 4:29 PM, Aurora arrived with food and soon started to feed them. The eyass not involved in the pecking got fed first. The eyass that was pecking got fed next. The eyass that got pecked tried to lunge for a bite, but the bit she took was too big for her. That eyass soon got fed. The other two got fed some more. The eyass that was pecking soon pecked the eyass that wasn't involved.
                <br><br>
                At 4:36 PM, Aurora stopped the feeding and tried to go sit on them. She didn't cover all of them.
                <br><br>
                I left at 4:55 PM. At that time, Aurora was trying to go sit on all of them.
                <br><br>
                At around 5:56 PM, the chat said that Bobby brought a rodent to the nest.
                <br><br>
                I joined again at 6:03 PM. Aurora was off of the eyasses, but she was still sitting near them.
                <br><br>
                At 6:17 PM, Bobby arrived and picked up a rat. He left at 6:19 PM and did not take the rat with him (I think).
                <br><br>
                I left at 6:28 PM.
                <br><br>
                The chat had mentioned there being a feeding, which may have started before 6:51 PM. They said that she settled down at 6:55 PM.

                The chat had said that there were feedings in the morning. They also said that there was one around 2:56 PM, but the eyasses weren't interested in eating.
                <br><br>
                According to the chat messages, the eyasses may have been alone on the nest at 3:31 PM. They also may have been pecking each other.
                <br><br>
                I joined the livestream at 4:02 PM. Aurora was sitting.
                <br><br>
                At 4:30 PM, Aurora got up and two eyasses started pecking each other. Aurora left at 4:31 PM. The eyass closest to the front sliced on the cardboard. That same eyass started pecking the other two.
                <br><br>
                At around 4:36 PM, Aurora returned. The front eyass tried preening herself. Aurora went to sit on them at 4:40 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 5:14 PM, Aurora got up and soon left. At 5:22 PM, Bobby arrived and seconds later, Aurora returned. Bobby later left.
                <br><br>
                It was a windy day today, which meant that it was easier for things on the nest to fly away. Some of the chat members had gotten attached to the cardboard that was first brought to the nest nine days ago, commenting on how much Aurora was trying to reposition it and how she wasn't sure where to put it. At 5:22 PM, the wind had almost blown it off the nest, but Aurora noticed it blowing away and stopped it before it flew away completely. She went to go put it back into the nest and sat down.
                <br><br>
                I had left the livestream at 5:23 PM, but checked in quickly at 5:48 PM. Aurora wasn't on the nest at the time, and neither was the cardboard. According to chat, it had blown away at 5:47 PM. Some of the chat members had gotten so attached to this piece of cardboard that they were sad that it was gone. I don't remember the exact comment, but someone had said that sometimes, it was the little things that mattered.
                <br><br>
                At around 5:48 PM, some of the eyasses were preening themselves.
                <br><br>
                At 7:59 PM, the chat said that Bobby took away a rat that wasn't eaten from yet.
                <br><br>
                I joined the livestream again at 8:37 PM. Aurora was sitting.
