                At 6:05 AM, the chat said that there was a feeding. The food may have been a rat/mouse that Bobby brought.
                <br><br>
                I joined the livestream at 11:27 AM and Aurora was sitting in the nest bowl. The livestream continued to freeze at times.
                <br><br>
                At around 12:08 PM, Bobby arrived, possibly with food. At 12:28 PM, the chat said that there was a feeding.
                <br><br>
                I checked in at 12:41 PM and Aurora was gone. At 12:46 PM, the chat said that Aurora brought a leafy twig to the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 12:48 PM, Aurora was feeding the eyasses with a rat. She may have left with the rat a minute later. At 12:52 PM, she returned and tried to feed them, but they weren't interested. She went to sit on them at 12:55 PM.
                <br><br>
                Aurora was preening the eyasses on several occasions, including at 1:08 PM, 1:17 PM, and 1:27 PM.
                <br><br>
                At around 1:52 PM, Aurora got up. One of the eyasses started pecking one of her siblings. When Aurora turned around to face the nest again, the eyass stopped. The pecking resumed at 2:07 PM. Aurora went to go sit on them at around 2:09 PM to 2:10 PM, but she wasn't covering all of them.
                <br><br>
                At 2:41 PM, Aurora got up. At around 2:47 PM, she started feeding them. At 2:55 PM, she left with the rat. At 3:02 PM, the chat said that she brought more greenery to the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 3:31 PM, Aurora got somewhat off of the eyasses and later left at 3:33 PM. At 3:37 PM, one of the eyasses was preening herself.
                <br><br>
                At 3:41 PM, Bobby arrived. He later left at 3:47 PM. At 3:53 PM, an eyass was preening herself.
                <br><br>
                I left at 3:53 PM and checked back at 5:25 PM. Aurora was sitting and covering all of the eyasses.
                <br><br>
                At 6:25 PM, the chat said that Bobby arrived with food.
                <br><br>
                I checked in again at 6:28 PM and Aurora was feeding them. She went to sit on them at 6:32 PM.

            <p class="montserrat-font">
                According to the chat, Aurora fed the eyasses with a rat at around 8 AM. She ate the rest of the rat afterward and left at 8:31 AM.
                <br><br>
                I quickly checked in at 9:44 AM and Aurora was sitting.
                <br><br>
                I joined the livestream at 11:56 AM and Aurora was sitting. She got up at 11:58 AM. One of the eyasses may have started to look grayer, moving into her next stage of development. All of the eyasses were sleepy.
                <br><br>
                At 12:06 PM, Bobby arrived with food, which may or may not have been a pigeon. Aurora took it from him and he left after a few seconds. Aurora was getting ready to feed the eyasses, but they were all asleep.
                <br><br>
                At 12:12 PM, Aurora was stretching her wings. She moved towards the food at 12:16 PM. She may have started a feeding at 12:18 PM. She took some leftovers, which may have been a wing, and left at 12:19 PM. At 12:22 PM, she returned with a thin branch with leaves on it. One of the eyasses was preening herself at 12:23 PM.
                <br><br>
                I left at 12:26 PM and returned at 1:14 PM. Bobby had just arrived with a pigeon. He left at 1:15 PM.

                I checked in at 1:31 PM and Bobby may have been here.
                <br><br>
                I checked in at 1:40 PM and Aurora was feeding the eyasses, starting to give them bigger pieces of food. Two of them were getting fed, while the other one was asleep. At one point, she tried to feed them a bigger piece, but it was too big for them to get it down. She also moved to feed the eyass that was lying down. She went to sit on them at 1:50 PM.
                <br><br>
                At around 2:05 PM, Aurora was preening the eyasses. She got up at 2:10 PM and started stretching at 2:26 PM. She left at 2:32 PM.

                At 3:10 PM, Bobby arrived and picked up the pigeon on the nest. He flew off with a leftover wing at 3:12 PM.

The other two eyasses both watched their sibling struggle with getting the piece down. At one point, they tried pulling at the piece. At 12:36 PM, the eyass continued to have trouble with that long piece of food. One of the other two was gently poking at the eyass having trouble.
