            <p class="montserrat-font">As we enter the month of March, we get closer to this year's nesting season. The hawks will be visiting more frequently until the eggs are laid (most likely sometime this month) at which at least one of them will stay at the nest throughout the whole day. Until then, here are some of the nest visits they have made in March:</p>
