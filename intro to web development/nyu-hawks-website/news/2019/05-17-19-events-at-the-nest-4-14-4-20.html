                At 11:29 AM, a chat member mentioned Aurora being on the nest.
                (I joined the livestream at 12:53 PM.)
                <br><br>
                Aurora was here at the time.
                <br><br>
                The livestream was freezing occasionally.
                <br><br>
                I noticed the frozen livestream at 1:53 PM. I refreshed and saw that Bobby was here now.
                <br><br>
                At around 4:36 PM, Aurora arrived and Bobby left.
                <br><br>
                At 6:42 PM, Bobby arrived, possibly with a rat. He left soon after. Aurora got up when he arrived and sat back down at 6:44 PM.
                <br><br>
                Days before, the chat had pointed out a light-up construction arrow sign down below on the street. Due to the camera angle, the arrow happened to line up with the nest and the chat had joked about how the arrow was pointing towards the nest, as if to say where the eggs are.
                <br><br>

            <p class="montserrat-font">
                The camera angle was adjusted to a closer view of the nest. This is in preparation of the soon-to-be-hatched eggs.
                <br><br>
                A chat member noted that Aurora left at 11:20 PM.

                Aurora was here at the time.
                <br><br>
                I checked in at 1:07 PM and see that Bobby is here with a new napkin/paper material.

                <br><br>
                At 3:53 PM, Aurora arrived on the ledge and went onto the nest. Bobby left soon after.
                <br><br>
                (I left the livestream at 4:29 PM and joined again at 6:04 PM.)
                <br><br>
                Aurora was here at the time.
                <br><br>
                At 7:34 PM, Bobby arrived and Aurora got up. She left at around 7:38 PM to 7:39 PM and Bobby left with her. He soon came back and went to go sit on the eggs.
                <br><br>
                The infrared night cam turned on at 7:41 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 8:03 PM, Aurora returned. Bobby got up and left at 8:07 PM.

            <p class="montserrat-font">
                During yesterday night and after midnight, a few of the chat members talked about one of the eggs being partially uncovered. However, the chatroom hawk expert noted that this wasn't anything to worry about in this stage of the eggs' development.
                <br><br>
                At 5:57 AM, a chat member said that Bobby was on the nest. He reportedly left at 6:01 AM and returned at 6:24 AM. A minute later, Aurora left.
                <br><br>
                At 9:35 AM, a chat member noted that Aurora arrived with a twig and that she placed it on the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 11:18 AM, the chat had talked about Bobby. At 11:20 AM, they talked about him bringing cardboard to the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 12:14 PM, a chat member had talked about Aurora, which may have meant that she was on the nest.
                <br><br>
                (I joined the livestream at 12:26 PM.)
                <br><br>
                Bobby was on the nest at the time.
                <br><br>
                At 1:45 PM, Aurora arrived on the ledge and went onto the nest. Bobby soon left. Aurora went to pick up the cardboard and soon sat down. She tried repositioning the cardboard.
                <br><br>
                The chat had started talking about there being a "fourth egg" in the nest. It was a round-shaped material of some sort, smaller than the size of a hawk egg.
                <br><br>
                
                <img class="secondary-news-image" src="../../images/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-15%20at%206.43.41%20PM.png" alt="A view of the three eggs and a 'fourth egg' as Aurora stands on the nest on April 15, 2019">
                
                <br><br>
                At and before 2:32 PM, Aurora had held the cardboard in her beak, attempting to reposition it again.
                <br><br>

                At 6:22 AM, a chat member noted that Aurora was here.
                <br><br>
                At 7:30 AM, a chat member noted that Bobby was here.
                <br><br>
                I checked in at 9:50 AM and Bobby was here. There was also a mouse on the nest that was here since before 8:24 AM.
                <br><br>
                I joined again at 2:03 PM and Bobby was here.
                <br><br>
                At around 2:32 PM, the cam went black. The live feed returned at 2:49 PM. Aurora was on the nest now. The rat/mouse that was on the nest earlier was gone now also.
                <br><br>
                At 3:58 PM, Bobby arrived on the nest and Aurora left soon after. Bobby went to pick up the cardboard and put it back down before sitting on the eggs.
                <br><br>
                I left the livestream at 4:25 PM and joined again at 5:35 PM. Bobby (I think) was on the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 6:00 PM, Aurora arrived and Bobby soon left. This was the last shift change for the day.
