                I joined the livestream at 3:28 PM. The eyasses were alone on the nest, along with a pigeon wing. It was rainy today.
                <br><br>
                At 4:31 PM, Aurora arrived with a pigeon. She soon started a feeding, using both the pigeon wing and the new pigeon. Her feathers were wet from the rain.
                <br><br>
                I left at 5:03 PM. By that time, the feeding had stopped. I returned at around 8:23 PM.
                <br><br>
                Aurora was preening the eyasses on several occasions, including at 8:24 PM, 10:05 PM, and 11:17 PM.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="cabin-font">May 13</h3>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">
                I joined the livestream at 12:52 PM. Aurora had left with a small leftover. An eyass was also trying to flap her wings.
                <br><br>
                At 12:58 PM, Aurora returned.
                <br><br>
                At 1:27 PM, Aurora picked up some leftovers, possibly some wing feathers, and flew off. She returned at 1:29 PM.
                <br><br>
                I checked in at 1:39 PM and there might have been a feeding.
                <br><br>
                At 1:44 PM, Aurora left. She returned at 1:46 PM.
                <br><br>
                The livestream had froze for me and when I refreshed it at 2:29 PM, Aurora was gone. She returned at 2:40 PM.
                <br><br>
                I checked in at 3:05 PM and Aurora was gone. At around 3:32 PM, she arrived on the ledge and walked to the nest.
                <br><br>
                At 3:38 PM, an eyass was flapping her wings.
                <br><br>
                At 3:39 PM, there may have been a bird attack on Aurora. It was very quick. The bird may have flew into Aurora and quickly flew away. Aurora wasn't fazed by the attack at all. According to the chat, one of the eyasses was watching it as it happened. There may have been a bird attack earlier as well, according to the chat.
                <br><br>
                I checked in at 5:40 PM and Aurora was gone. She returned at 5:46 PM with a pigeon. She started feeding the eyasses and they were orderly in their eating. She stopped the feeding sometime before 6:10 PM. She tried to go sit on the eyasses, presumably because of the rain, but they were too big to fit under her. Aurora was very wet and fluffy because of the rain.
                <br><br>
                At 6:55 PM, Aurora started feeding the eyasses again. At 7:11 PM, she flew off with some leftovers.
                <br><br>
                At 7:34 PM, Aurora returned on the ledge and walked to the nest. She looked drier than she was before.
                <br><br>
                At around 7:49 PM, Aurora started feeding them again. At 7:52 PM, she flew off with a leftover wing. She returned sometime before 8:02 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 8:05 PM, the infrared night cam turned on.
                <br><br>
                Aurora was preening the eyasses on several occasions, including at 8:22 PM and 8:31 PM.
            </p>

            <p class="montserrat-font">
                According to the chat, there was a feeding in the morning and also a pigeon brought to the nest at around 1 PM.
                <br><br>
                I joined the livestream at 2:14 PM. Aurora was on the nest with the eyasses.
                <br><br>
                At 2:17 PM, Aurora took off with some leftover bird wings. She returned at 2:20 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 2:23 PM, Aurora may have tried to feed the eyasses with some leftovers on the nest. She also ate some of it herself. She flew off with the leftovers at 2:27 PM and returned at 2:31 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 3:14 PM, Aurora looked as if she were tracking something in the air. This also happened at 3:31 PM.
                <br><br>
                At 5:17 PM, Aurora left and came back about a minute later. She left again at 5:58 PM and returned at 6:09 PM.
                <br><br>
                The eyasses continued flapping their wings at several points today, including at 6:56 PM.
