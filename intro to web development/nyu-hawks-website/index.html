            <h2 class="cabin-font">Welcome to the NYU Hawks website!</h2>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">Up on the 12th floor of Bobst Library, sitting on a window ledge right outside the NYU president's office is a red-tailed hawks' nest that has been there since 2011. While hawk partners may have changed over the years, one thing that remains constant is their continual return to the nest every year to raise their young.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">The NYU Hawk Cam provides viewers with a chance to see the lives of these hawks as they rebuild their nest, lay eggs, incubate them, and potentially raise some eyasses into successful fledglings.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">Since this is a live webcam, due to the unpredictability of nature, there may be times where you see something upsetting that you may not wish to see. In those times, viewers must decide for themselves if they are comfortable with watching.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">As of recent years, NYU does not officially endorse naming the hawks or their eyasses. However, long-time hawk watchers named the two adult hawks before the rule was put in place and usually refer to them that way, including in the hawk cam chatroom. The male hawk is named Bobby and the current female hawk is named Aurora in the chatroom and named Sadie on Roger_Paw's website. On this website, the two hawks will generally be referred to as 'the male hawk' and 'the female hawk,' but will occasionally be called 'Bobby' and 'Aurora.'</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">While eyasses in past seasons were often named by viewers, eyasses in the past two seasons have been following a naming convention consisting of a letter and a number that indicates hatching order. Last year, the eyasses were named H1, H2, and H3.</p>
            
            <p class="montserrat-font">If you would like to learn more about past seasons, visit <a href="https://rogerpaw.com">Roger_Paw's website</a> (under 'Archives') and the <a href="http://www.urbanhawks.blogs.com/">Urban Hawks blog</a> (under the Category 'Washington Sq. Red-tailed Hawks') or for a brief overview, visit the About page on this website.</p>
