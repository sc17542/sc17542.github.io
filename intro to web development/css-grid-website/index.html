            <li>If possible, avoid wearing masks that block any part of your vision.</li>
            <li>Carry a glow stick or a flashlight or put reflective tape on your costume to make sure drivers can see you at night.</li>
            <li>Wear costumes that won't cause you to trip and fall.</li>
            <li>Trick-or-treat with family members or friends instead of going alone.</li>
            <li>Never go inside a stranger's home, even if they say the candy is inside.</li>
            <li>Trick-or-treat in neighborhoods that you're familiar with.</li>
