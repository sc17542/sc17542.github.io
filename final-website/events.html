                    <i>Spirographs of Venus</i>, a beautiful new <i>Math Square</i> experience, opened on Friday, November 23.  This interactive exhibit was a winning submission at <i>Expressions</i>, the 2018 MoMath hackathon.  Conjuring up the Renaissance-era discovery of the Pentagram of Venus — the floral pattern that emerges when the orbital path of Venus is plotted in relation to the Earth — this innovative new experience invites you to step onto the <i>Math Square</i> and alter the universe beneath your feet!

                    Sometimes just a little bit of mathematical analysis yields a really profound advantage.  Let’s see this in action, kids versus adults!  In this friendly, competitive game, the kids will get a small amount of math training, and then will challenge the grownups to a few seemingly simple games of skill or tests of super powers such as clairvoyance or telepathy.  Who will win?  A well-educated, sophisticated adult New Yorker, or a kid in elementary school who knows a little math?  You decide!

                    For thousands of years, mathematicians have used the timeless art of logic to see the world more clearly.  Today, truth is buried under soundbites, spin, memes, divisive arguments, and “fake news.”  In an age where seeing clearly is more important than ever, mathematician and author Dr. Eugenia Cheng takes a careful scalpel to politics, privilege, sexism, and dozens of other real-world situations in her insightful and engaging new book, <i>The Art of Logic in an Illogical World</i>.

Some of the very best magic tricks invented over the years have involved serious mathematics, including concepts from number theory, group theory, recursion theory, topology, coding theory, and cryptography.  Conversely, and somewhat more surprisingly, a great deal of nontrivial and important mathematics has been discovered in these areas in recent years due to corresponding developments in magic.  In fact, these mathematical ideas have also had important applications in areas beyond magic.  Join Fields Medalist and Princeton University Professor Manjul Bhargava in an engaging exploration of magic tricks and the beautiful mathematical ideas that drive them.
